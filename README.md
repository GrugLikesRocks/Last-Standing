***An Introduction to Rising Revenant - The Ultimate Defense Game*** 


Embark on a journey into a new world, where revenants establish outposts amidst the untamed wilds, each bracing for a series of cataclysmic events. Rising Revenant isn't just a game; it's a test of your strategy, resilience, and foresight.

**On-Chain Events**


The precise location of each outpost is stored securely on-chain. Every X (TBC) amount of blocks, a random event strikes, determined transparently via an immutable on-chain method. This is visually represented on the game's tactical map.

**The Map**

The Map is a vibrant realm of burgeoning outposts. While these outposts thrive, they are constantly under threat from five looming perils:

Plague: A virulent disease that can wipe out your revenants.

Goblin Attack: Mischief-makers that emerge from the shadows to raid and plunder.

Earthquake: Ground-shaking tremors that threaten to shatter your defenses.

Hurricane: Destructive winds that can dismantle structures in their wake.

Dragon Attack: Majestic but deadly creatures that descend from the skies with fiery fury.

**Defend Your Outpost**

To safeguard your outpost, you have multiple defense mechanisms to choose from:

Food Storage: Vital to keep your revenants nourished and resilient against the plague.

Barricade: A stronghold against the marauding goblin invaders.

Castle: An emblem of might and stability, able to stand firm against the force of earthquakes.

Obsidian Bunker: The pinnacle of protection, offering refuge during the harshest hurricanes.

Dragon Shelter: Tailored with materials resistant to dragon flames, providing sanctuary from their aerial assaults.

**Boost Your Defenses**

Enhance your survival chances by strengthening your defenses. While each defensive structure has its inherent resistance, reinforcing them can be the deciding factor between endurance and demise. The costs involved in these enhancements contribute to the grand prize pool.

**The Ultimate Prize**

The proud owner of the last-standing outpost reaps a rich pool of $LORDS, sourced from defense setup fees and game initiation. The value of this pool corresponds directly to the total LORDS gathered during gameplay, with a fraction allocated for game developers and Biblio DAO.

**Trade and Tact**

Each outpost and reinforcement in Rising Revenant adheres to the ERC721 NFT standards. Players can trade their outposts and their defences at any game phase, facilitating strategic maneuvers and potential shifts in the map's balance of power.

**Conclusion**

Rising Revenant offers an exhilarating mix of strategy, chance, and foresight, making it a captivating endeavor for gamers and crypto enthusiasts. Will you rise to the challenge and etch your name in the annals of this adventure?
